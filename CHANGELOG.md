# [1.0.0](https://github.com/voltsonic/javascript-izimodal-wrap/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (2021-01-29)

```
This is a major breaking release from v0.10.1 and it's recommended to go thru all your current iterations and testing before updating production.
```

### Moved
- To new class based wrap for more containerized approach.

### Cleaned up
- How themes (aka modes) now work. Allows you to set global options for title/subtitle/icon/color as well as per each wrap instance to allow for less configuring between instances.
